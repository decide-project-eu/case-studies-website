# Aim

This tool visualizes pathogen-specific lab results of field samples obtained from cattle over Europe. It shows the historical trend, dynamics and current presence of specific pathogens per area. It holds the potential for early warning and to support decision-making on farm to control infectious diseases, such as antimicrobial use, vaccination, and purchase of animals.

# Data manipulation

Only [anonymous data](https://decide-project-eu.github.io/case-studies-website/tutorials/anonymisation.html) is used to create this dashboard.

## Examples of R-code and Python

-   Lab 1
-   Lab 2
-   Lab 3

## Load the necessary libraries

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

package_list <- c("data.table", "tidyverse", "naniar", "stringr", "readr",  "dplyr", 
                  "magrittr", "readxl", "writexl", "sjmisc", "tidyr")

for (pkg in package_list) {
  if (pkg %in% rownames(.packages()) == FALSE)
  {library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)}

}
```

## Adding of rows for pathogens

For example when all results are reported in one field (*e.g.* sequencing data).

```{r, eval = FALSE}

barometer_dt <- barometer_dt_raw %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    HS = ifelse(str_detect(pathogens, "Histophilus somni"), 1, 0),
    MH = ifelse(str_detect(pathogens, "Mannheimia haemolytica"), 1, 0),
    PM = ifelse(str_detect(pathogens, "Pasteurella multocida"), 1, 0),
    BCV = ifelse(str_detect(pathogens, "Bovine coronavirus"), 1, 0),
    MB = ifelse(str_detect(pathogens, "Mycoplasmopsis bovis"), 1, 0),
    PI3 = ifelse(str_detect(pathogens, "Bovine respirovirus 3"), 1, 0),
    BRSV = ifelse(str_detect(pathogens, "Bovine orthopneumovirus"), 1, 0),
  )

```

## Example with dummy file & final format

Please find here a [dummy file](.....) which can help you understand the different steps we are taking in the next chunk. You can find the step-by-step explanation below the R chunk.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

barometer_dt <- barometer_dt_raw %>%

    ) %>% 
  tidyr::separate(ADDRESS, c('Postal_code', 'City')) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    Postal_code = as.double(Postal_code),
    Filenumber = str_sub(Dossier, 1, 12),
    Samplenumber = str_sub(Dossier, -3),
    Country ='Belgium',

        between(as.numeric(Postal_code), 8000, 8999) ~ 'West Flanders',
        TRUE ~ 'East Flanders'
    )
  )%>%
  dplyr::select(
    Filenumber,
    Diagnostic_test,
    Samplenumber,
    Country,
    Lab_reference,
    Sample_type,
    Breed,
    PM,
    MH,
    HS,
    MB,
    BRSV,
    PI3,
    BCV,
    Date,

  ) %>%
  dplyr::distinct() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    Filenumber = sha256_hash(as.character(Filenumber)),
    Farm_ID = sha256_hash(as.character(Samplenumber))
  ) 
```

First we make sure that all column names are in the final format and understandable (in English):

-   <small> Filenumber, Samplenumber, Date, Sample_type, Diagnostic_test, Farm_ID, Postal_code, Breed, Province

-   The following abbreviations for the 7 most important pathogens involved in bovine respiratory disease are used: PM (*Pasteurella multocida*), MB (*Mycoplasmopsis bovis*, previously *Mycoplasma bovis*), MH (*Mannheimia haemolytica*), HS (*Histophilus somni*), BRSV (bovine respiratory syncytial virus), PI3 (parainfluenza-type 3), and BCV (bovine coronavirus)

Subsequently we mutate/add data to the final format:

-   Samplenumber: in case more than one sample is submitted to the lab under one filenumber (*e.g.* 001, 002 or 1, 2, ..)

-   Date (DD-MM-YYYY): either date of sampling or creation date in lab. *The date of sampling is preferred, however, when this date is (often) lacking, it may be easier to take the creation date of the lab. This is only recommended when time between taking samples and creation date remains short (1-2 days)*

-   Geolocation at the province level. Therefore, in this case we needed to separate the postal code (*e.g.* 2388) from the municipality/city to extract the province (*e.g.* Brussels)

-   Country (*e.g.* Belgium) should be mentioned in a separate column

-   Lab reference: a number (*e.g.* 3)

<!-- -->

-   Sample type: '*BAL*' (bronchoalveolar lavage), '*Swab*' (nasal swab, eye swab, deep nasopharyngeal swab, ... from a living animal), '*TTA*' (transtracheal aspirate/wash), '*Autopsy*' (all samples from carcasses) or '*Unknown*'

-   Breed or production type: '*Dairy*', '*Beef*', '*Mixed'*,'*Veal*', '*Fattening* *calves*', '*Unknown*'

-   Diagnostic test: '*Culture*', '*PCR*', '*NPS*' (nanopore sequencing) or '*Paired serum*'. *In this dataset the Diagnostic test has already been mentioned in the correct format* </small>

-   Finally, the Filenumber and Farm_ID are anonymized by using the [SHA-256 hashing function](https://decide-project-eu.github.io/case-studies-website/tutorials/anonymisation.html)

## How to handle results?

The result can be either 'negative' (0), 'positive' (1) or 'not tested' (NA):

-   PCR: when to consider a test results positive or negative will be at the discretion of the laboratory (cutoff values may differ per lab). Dubious test results such as 'not conclusive', 'no test results due to inhibition', are recommended to file as not tested (NA).

-   Culture (*Pasteurellaceae*): it is expected that culture results are either positive (1) or negative (0). For example, when a swab has been cultured on blood agar plates, we assume that *P. multocida, M. haemolytica,* and *Histophilus somni* are tested. For example, when only *P. multocida* is present, the result for that specific sample should be reported as: PM (1), MH (0), HS (0). Dubious test results due to overgrowth by for example *Proteus species* could be filed as not tested (NA) for all *Pasteurellaceae*.

-   Culture (*M. bovis*): for *M. bovis* specific culture media are necessary, however, when tested, result can be positive (1) or negative (0). Dubious test results due to overgrowth by fungi could be filed as not tested (NA).

-   Nanopore sequencing: when to consider a test results positive or negative will be at the discretion of the laboratory (cutoff values may differ per lab).
