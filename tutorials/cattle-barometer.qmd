# Aim

This tool visualizes pathogen-specific lab results of field samples obtained from cattle over Europe. It shows the historical trend, dynamics and current presence of specific pathogens per area. It holds the potential for early warning and to support decision-making on farm to control infectious diseases, such as antimicrobial use, vaccination, and purchase of animals.

# Data manipulation

Only [anonymous data](https://decide-project-eu.github.io/case-studies-website/tutorials/anonymisation.html) is used to create this dashboard.

## Examples of R-code and Python

-   Lab 1
-   Lab 2
-   Lab 3

## How to handle results?

The result can be either 'negative' (0), 'positive' (1) or 'not tested' (NA):

-   PCR: when to consider a test results positive or negative will be at the discretion of the laboratory (cutoff values may differ per lab). Dubious test results such as 'not conclusive', 'no test results due to inhibition', are recommended to file as not tested (NA).

-   Culture (*Pasteurellaceae*): it is expected that culture results are either positive (1) or negative (0). For example, when a swab has been cultured on blood agar plates, we assume that *P. multocida, M. haemolytica,* and *Histophilus somni* are tested. For example, when only *P. multocida* is present, the result for that specific sample should be reported as: PM (1), MH (0), HS (0). Dubious test results due to overgrowth by for example *Proteus species* could be filed as not tested (NA) for all *Pasteurellaceae*.

-   Culture (*M. bovis*): for *M. bovis* specific culture media are necessary, however, when tested, result can be positive (1) or negative (0). Dubious test results due to overgrowth by fungi could be filed as not tested (NA).

-   Nanopore sequencing: when to consider a test results positive or negative will be at the discretion of the laboratory (cutoff values may differ per lab).
