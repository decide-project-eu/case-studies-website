# System Model

![Figure 1: Non-Ontology Based (Traditional One) generic framework of Farm Animal Data Management](ontologies-figure-1.png){fig-align="center"}

Non-ontology-based systems require rewriting the cleaning code each time new data arrives, making it time-consuming and tedious. These systems lack interoperability, flexibility, reusability, and accessibility, posing limitations in data integration, handling, and adaptability.

![Figure 2: Ontology-Driven Knowledge-based framework of Farm Animal Data Management (ODKFADM)](ontologies-figure-2.png){fig-align="center"}

In this use case, we utilize the ODKFADM framework to evaluate cattle-related data (DGZ), It involves collecting raw data from different data sources i.e. DGZ, and including information about farm identification, geo-location, infectious diseases, PCR, and bacterial culture results. This framework enables effective analysis of the data, leading to insights into cattle health

## Step 1: Data Acquisition and RDF conversions

![Figure 3: Data Acquisition and RDF Conversions](ontologies-figure-3.png)

In Figure 3, we read heterogeneous raw data using pandas, and R data frames, and then convert them into RDF format.

## Step 2: Species-Specific Ontology (LHO)

![Figure 4: Graphical Representation of LHO](ontologies-figure-4.jpg)

## Step 3: RDF Data and Ontology Integration (Mapping)

In this step we map the RDF data with LHO which enhances the reasoning and query capabilites

## Step 4: Knowledge graph (Ontology Update)

Resulted into a knowledge graph

## Step 5: Reasoning and Query

Figure 6 and 7 shows Query and query results that Filtering positive PathogenResults and MycoplasmaResults associated with CattleSample

## Step 6: Visualization and Analysis

We choose Tableau for the visualization method. It provides meaningful insights to explore the knowledge graph. For this, we need a working ODBC connection to a Virtuoso Instance and ODBC or JDBC Compliant version of Tableau or Tableau Server. For ODBC connection to virtuoso, the link is: [Visualizing SPARQL Results in Tableau \| by Daniel Heward-Mills \| OpenLink Virtuoso Weblog \| Medium](https://medium.com/virtuoso-blog/virtuoso-tableau-sparql-f9411852a87d)
